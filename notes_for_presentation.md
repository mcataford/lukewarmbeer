- follow up on last time. Thanks Marc
- recap:

- Taito's Ice Cold Beer from 1983
- The level 10 switch in the Ice Cold Beer machine at the Zed80 arcade bar in Toronto is broken, so even if you win it looks like you don't. I'm not mad.

- yeah so let's make a cheap ripoff (buy Zeek's Peak on steam)
  - layers of plywood
  - telescoping rod
  - motors and pulley
  - controls and switches
  - microcontroller
  - display
  - music and sound effects

- easy!

- problems:
  - pulleys
  - motor speed control
  - running out of pins
  - wiring
  - not knowing how to write C good
